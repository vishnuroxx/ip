# UI test plan

Add each new console test using the required Aim, Command, Input, and Expected output blocks. Commands run from the project root.

The compile step excludes `src/main/java/hu9o/gui/` (the JavaFX GUI) with `-not -path "*/gui/*"`, since those files need the JavaFX libraries on the classpath and the console entry point `hu9o.Hu9o` does not depend on them.

## Test case: exit-greeting

Aim:
```text
Verify that the application starts and exits politely when the user enters `bye`.
```

Command:
```shell
javac -d build/classes $(find src/main/java -name "*.java" -not -path "*/gui/*") && mkdir -p build/ui-tests/exit-greeting/data && : > build/ui-tests/exit-greeting/data/taskData.txt && (cd build/ui-tests/exit-greeting && java -cp ../../classes hu9o.Hu9o)
```

Input:
```text
bye
```

Expected output:
```text

## Test case: load-saved-tasks

Aim:
```text
Verify that Hu9o loads saved todo, deadline, and event tasks, including their completion statuses.
```

Command:
```shell
javac -d build/classes $(find src/main/java -name "*.java" -not -path "*/gui/*") && mkdir -p build/ui-tests/load-saved-tasks/data && printf 'T| |read book|\nD|X|submit assignment|12/08/26 3 PM|\nE| |project meeting|12/08/26 2 PM|12/08/26 4 PM|\n' > build/ui-tests/load-saved-tasks/data/taskData.txt && (cd build/ui-tests/load-saved-tasks && java -cp ../../classes hu9o.Hu9o)

## Test case: global-list-unaffected-by-contacts

Aim:
```text
Verify that adding a person does not change the behaviour or output of any existing task command: the rest of this input is byte-for-byte the same task-lifecycle sequence as the task-lifecycle test case, just preceded by one person command.
```

Command:
```shell
javac -d build/classes $(find src/main/java -name "*.java" -not -path "*/gui/*") && mkdir -p build/ui-tests/global-list-unaffected-by-contacts/data && : > build/ui-tests/global-list-unaffected-by-contacts/data/taskData.txt && (cd build/ui-tests/global-list-unaffected-by-contacts && java -cp ../../classes hu9o.Hu9o)
```

Input:
```text
person Ivy Chua /phone 91112222 /email ivy@example.com
todo read book
deadline submit assignment /by 12/08/26 3 PM
event project meeting /from 12/08/26 2 PM /to 12/08/26 4 PM
list
mark 2
unmark 2
delete 2
list
unknown
bye
```

Expected output:
```text

## Test case: greeting-command

Aim:
```text
Verify that a greeting such as "hi" gets a friendly reply instead of an unknown-command error, and that it does not disturb the task list.
```

Command:
```shell
javac -d build/classes $(find src/main/java -name "*.java" -not -path "*/gui/*") && mkdir -p build/ui-tests/greeting-command/data && : > build/ui-tests/greeting-command/data/taskData.txt && (cd build/ui-tests/greeting-command && java -cp ../../classes hu9o.Hu9o)

hi
hello

## Test case: auto-create-missing-data-files

Aim:
```text
Verify that Storage and ContactStorage create an empty save file (and the data/ folder) as soon as loading finds one missing, rather than only after the first save. The program is given no input at all, so it crashes on EOF right after loading and before it can ever reach a save -- its own output is discarded, and only the resulting data/ folder contents are checked.
```

Command:
```shell
javac -d build/classes $(find src/main/java -name "*.java" -not -path "*/gui/*") && rm -rf build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files && mkdir -p build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files && ((cd build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files && java -cp ../../classes hu9o.Hu9o > /dev/null 2>&1) ; true) && find build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files/data -type f | sort
```

Input:
```text

```

Expected output:
```text
build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files/data/contactData.txt
build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files/data/contactLinks.txt
build/ui-tests/auto-create-missing-data-files/data/taskData.txt
```
